## 📚 About

This project is a colourful patchwork generator built with Python 🐍 and the `graphix.py` library — a simplified graphics module made specifically for educational use.

It prompts the user to select a patchwork size and three colours, and then generates a grid of algorithmic patch designs in a graphical window.
